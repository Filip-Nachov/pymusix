## Overview

PyMusix is a Python package designed to retrieve information about a song, including details like the artist, album, release date, genres, and lyrics. The package utilizes the Spotify and Musixmatch APIs to gather this information.

## Installation

To install PyMusix from GitHub, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:
    
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/your_username/pymusix.git
	cd pymusix 
	```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the [project root](https://github.com/TrueMyst/pymusix/tree/main/pymusix). The file should contain the following:

	```bash
	SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
	SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
	MUSIXMATCH_USER_TOKEN=your_musixmatch_user_token
	```
Obtain the Spotify client ID and client secret from the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/).
 For the Musixmatch user token, you can follow the guide [here](https://github.com/khanhas/genius-spicetify#musicxmatch).
    
You are now ready to use PyMusix!

## Usage

To use PyMusix, instantiate the `PyMusix` class with the desired song details. The class will fetch information from Spotify and Musixmatch APIs and provide various attributes with the song details.

Example:

```python
from pymusix import PyMusix

song_info = PyMusix(q_name="Song Name", q_artist="Artist Name")
print("Track Name:", song_info.track_name)
print("Artist:", song_info.track_artist)
print("Lyrics:", song_info.track_lyrics)
# ... and more
```
